List and explain the different type of JOIN clauses.

INNER JOIN - return all of the rows for which there is at least one match in both tables. (default type)
LEFT JOIN - return all of the rows from the left table and the matched rows from the right table. The result
            will contain all of the result of the left table, even if the JOIN condition doesn't match any record
            on the right table. The columns that does not match the right table will have a value of NULL.
RIGHT JOIN - Opposite of LEFT JOIN
FULL JOIN - returns all of the rows for which there is a match in EITHER of the tables. Similar to applying both a left and right join together.
CROSS JOIN - returns all record where each row from the first table is combined with each row from the second table. 
            Basically a cartesion products of the set of rows from the join tables.
