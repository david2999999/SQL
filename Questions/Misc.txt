SELECT count(*) AS total FROM orders; 
100

SELECT count(*) AS cust_123_total FROM orders WHERE customer_id = '123';
15

SELECT count(*) AS cust_not_123_total FROM orders WHERE customer_id <> '123';
It depends if there are NULL values in the table
If the table contains 1 NULL customer_id, the output will be 84.
