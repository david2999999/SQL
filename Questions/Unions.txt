What does UNION do? What is the difference between UNION and UNION ALL?

Union merges the content of two structually compatible tables into a single combined table. 
Union will omit duplicates, while UNION ALL will include duplicates. 
The performance of UNION ALL is usually better than UNION because UNION need to do addition work of removing duplicates.
