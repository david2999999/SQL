## First Normal Form (1NF)
- It should only have single(atomic) valued attributes/columns.
- Values stored in a column should be of the same domain
- All the columns in a table should have unique names.
- And the order in which data is stored, does not matter.

## Second Normal Form (2NF)
- For a table to be in the Second Normal form, it should be in the First Normal form and it should not have Partial Dependency.
- Partial Dependency exists, when for a composite primary key, any attribute in the table depends only on a part of the primary key and not on the complete primary key.
- To remove Partial dependency, we can divide the table, remove the attribute which is causing partial dependency, and move it to some other table where it fits in well.

## Third Normal Form (3NF)
- It is in the Second Normal form.
- And, it doesn't have Transitive Dependency.


## Boyce and Codd Normal Form (BCNF)
### Boyce and Codd Normal Form is a higher version of the Third Normal form. This form deals with certain type of anomaly that is not handled by 3NF. A 3NF table which does not have multiple overlapping candidate keys is said to be in BCNF. For a table to be in BCNF, following conditions must be satisfied:

- R must be in 3rd Normal Form
- and, for each functional dependency ( X â†’ Y ), X should be a super Key.
